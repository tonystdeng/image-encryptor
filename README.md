# PNG Image Information Encrypt/Embedding Python Library/Desktop Application 

## Explaination
This project's idea is to embed informations into images by modifying the binarys inside the file, making the image still usable as usual while carrying an information

Unlike triditional Steganography, this project does not modify any pixel value of the image, making it even more secure.
## Usage
Fist, make sure you installed python alone side some packages:
- PySide6 - GUI control for Desktop Application
-
  
(yes it was only one idk why did I make a list)

Then you can start on either run python file [image-encryptor-gui.py](image-encryptor-gui.py) to work with a Desktop Application or import [image-encryptor-lib.py](image-encryptor-lib.py) to use the utilities in your own program.
